            <p>Balck Widow was just bad. It was dull, repetitve story, boring action sequences, forgettable villan, and oevrall, one of the 
                worst Marvel movies ever.

            <p>I had very high expectations for this movie, especially the for villan, Gorr the God Butcher, but it turned out to be boring, had too much humor, 
                very fast-paced, and most importantly, they wasted Gorr's character.

                The movies from here on are all decent movies. For instance, this movie was almost perfect; they handled the cultural aspect respectfully, 
                the story was fresh, the action sequences were very engaging, it was funny, the visuals were top-notch, and the actors' performance was great.

            <p>
                This movie was first and foremost very emotional, due to actor's Chadwick Boseman passing. I found the movie to be very well-paced and the actors' 
                performance was perfect, especially Actress Angela Bassett's performace as Queen Ramonda and actor Tenoch Huerta as Namor. Overall, a great movie.

            <p>
                Spider-Man: No way Home is one of Marvel's best movies ever; the plot was well-written, the characters were very well-portrayed, the villans were 
                unforgettable, and the action sequences were awsome. However, the best part was [SPOILER ALERT] the nostalgia for a couple of returning characters.

            <p>
                Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one of those movies which are more of an experience rather than a typical movie. It was truly a wild and
                crazy ride; jumping from one scene to the next, without having a chance to take a breath, which, for this movie, worked quite well. The plot 
                was very engaging and the visuals were astonishing. An honorable mention to Elizabeth Olsen for her oustanding portrayal of the Scarlet Witch.

            <p>
                And now, finally, my favorite movie of phase 4 - Eternals. I know that many Marvel fans aren't quite fond of this movie - I know some who didn't even 
                see it - but to me, Eternals was a spectacle. It had a fresh plot, exciting characters, perfect pacing, no scene felt rushed or streched, the visuals 
                were otherworldly (literllay), the actors' performance was on point, the movie's overall aesthetic was very engaing, and, of course, the musical score was enchanting.
