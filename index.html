    <h1>Marvel Studios: Movies of Phase 4 (Review + Info)</h1> 
    <p>Now that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has hit the theaters all around the world, this marks the end of Marvel 
        Studios' phase 4 - regarding movies. There had been a total of 7 movies starting from Black Widow (2021) and ending 
        with Wakanda Forever, and throughout, Mavel has introduced many new characters such as America Chavez, the Eternals, 
        Shang Chi, Namor & the Mighty Thor. Generally, movies of phase 4 haven't been favorable among the fans, many criticizing 
        the “degrade in quality” from earlier movies such as Avengers: Infinity War & Endgame. However, I quite enjoyed most of these 
        movies, and if you look at this phase on its own and as an introductory phase, you would enjoy it too.<br><br>
        Below are all of Marvel Studios' phase 4 movies listed from least to most favorable accroding to me and a quick review of each movie. Also, you can find out more 
        about each movie by clicking on <strong>Movie Info</strong>. Here we go:
